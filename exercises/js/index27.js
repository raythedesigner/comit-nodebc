/*
Create a new index27.js file.

Define a firstNumber and secondNumber variables.

Assign each variable a number type value.

Code the following operations:

- Adding both variables
- Subtracting both variables
- Multiplying both variables
- Dividing both variables
- Remainder from both variables

For each operation show the following output:

- Example: I add 2 + 3 and the result is 5 (where 2 and 3 are firstNumber and secondNumber and 5 it's the operation result)
- Use a template variable for each output and console.log()
*/

const firstNumber = 10;
const secondNumber = 7;

// Adding both variables
console.log(`I add ${firstNumber} and ${secondNumber} and the result is ${firstNumber + secondNumber}.`);

// Subtracting both variables
console.log(`I subtract ${firstNumber} by ${secondNumber} and the result is ${firstNumber - secondNumber}.`);

// Multiplying both variables
console.log(`I multiply ${firstNumber} and ${secondNumber} and the result is ${firstNumber * secondNumber}.`);

// Dividing both variables
console.log(`I divide ${firstNumber} by ${secondNumber} and the result is ${firstNumber / secondNumber}.`);

// Remainder from both variables
console.log(`I divide ${firstNumber} by ${secondNumber} and the remainder is ${firstNumber % secondNumber}.`);
